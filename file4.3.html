      Recently, my relationship with Roland has been so smooth that I feel like I'm walking on air. I think it even has a positive impact on my life and studies. I guess this is why I initially decided to pursue him; I felt that he brought me positive things, and I'm always happy when I'm with him. We chat about lunch and share our daily lives. Like all long-distance couples, Catherine even thought our interactions were sweet when she saw our chat logs. The word "sweet" is very unfamiliar to me. I never thought I would fall in love and show a shy expression when talking about a man. Because my life has always made me feel that relationships aren't that important, and might even be a hindrance when necessary. But Roland is different from anyone else I've met; he makes me feel that we really have a chance. I think I like him, do I?
