We started messaging on the 7th, I said goodnight to him on the 15th, and he started actively chatting with me and even called me on the 23rd. He said goodnight to me on the 24th. I think he must have liked me a little too. I spent a whole month getting him used to having me around after work. Huge progress, I'm so happy. Even if we don't end up together, we'll still be good friends.        <br/><br/>
