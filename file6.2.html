          I am currently organizing my psychology final. I have to say that because of this project, I revisited this relationship that occupied almost five months of my life. When I looked back at the chat logs from February and March, I still couldn't help but smile wryly. It turns out I liked him so intensely back then. I have never regretted suggesting breaking up with him. In fact, when I handed him the choice about the future, I knew we would switch to a different way of interacting. I didn't do well during the time I was separated from him. Although even my family didn't realize I had gone through a breakup, my friends who knew thought I wasn't hurt. But actually, I spent a long time getting used to days without him. It was very difficult at the beginning. Even hearing his voice elsewhere could instantly make me sad. I would wrap myself in a blanket and let that dull pain erode me.
