  No relationship is bad within three months, so that's probably why I felt there was no problem between us. When we first met, the things I recommended to him gave me the feeling that he would really do them, and we had so much to talk about every day. Even the cats I saw on the street, I had to show him. Once, I told him that applying a facial mask in the winter morning felt like local frostbite, and he told me he could try washing his face in the middle of the night.
     Although I don't want to admit it, the initial passion between us is gone. Three months have passed, and we've gone from winter to spring. Maybe, compared to those relationships that end suddenly, I will face a story more like a "narrow door." Breaking off little by little, helplessly moving towards the end. Until one day, we confess to each other that we don't actually like each other that much. I have never been able to prevent any change I don't like from happening, but I think I will slowly get used to it. I will learn to hold onto what I can grasp and learn to let go of things I like and cherish very much but don't belong to me.
